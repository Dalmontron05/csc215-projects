// Main C++ file
//TODO: After the professor visits, make a bell sound ring signaling the end of the classroom portion of the tour.
//TODO: Then allow the user to end the simulation or to run it again using a loop. 
//TODO: potentially for loop if statements might miss outputing anything if user inputs something that's not a professor's name. consider making the "else" statement in the for loop a function. Call that function in the else, and prevent the future loop from running if it does (maybe with a boolean).
